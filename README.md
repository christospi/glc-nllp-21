### Abstract

In this work, we study the task of classifying legal texts written in the Greek language. We introduce and make publicly available a novel dataset based on Greek
legislation, consisting of more than 47 thousand official, categorized Greek legislation resources. We experiment with this dataset and evaluate a battery of
advanced methods and classifiers, ranging from traditional machine learning and RNN-based methods to state-of-the-art Transformer-based methods.

We show that recurrent architectures with domain-specific word embeddings offer improved overall performance while being competitive even to transformer-based 
models. Finally, we show that cutting-edge multilingual and monolingual transformer-based models brawl on the top of the classifiersâ€™ ranking, making us question
the necessity of training monolingual transfer learning models as a rule of thumb.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the task of Greek legal text classification is considered in an open research project, while also Greek is a
language with very limited NLP resources in general.
